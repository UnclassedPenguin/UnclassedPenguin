Hey, I'm Tyler (@UnclassedPenguin). I am interested in technology of all sorts. Have a history working at an ISP and doing IT. I'd really like to advance my skills in programming and start contributing to open source projects. 
Currently I'm learning Ruby/JavaScript as well as working on my html/css. 
Thanks for checking out my GitHub. I also have a [blog](https://blog.unclassed.ca). 
Happy Coding :)
